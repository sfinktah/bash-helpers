## Installation

Just a bunch of bash aliases that are probably pretty perculiar to me

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sfinktah/bash-helpers.git ~/bin/saved
```

Loaded from `~/.bash_profile` via:

```shell
. ~/bin/saved/loadSavedFunctions.inc.sh && loadSavedFunctions
```

Edited and saved via:

```shell
vimfn existing_function
savefn existing_function
```
